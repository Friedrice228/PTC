# PTC
Program that reads a FITS data type in order to analyze the CCD used to take the image and create a Photon Transfer Curve
(PTC).
Eventually, more data types will be able to be accepted. FITS files can be of any size (1, 2 or many frames) and the program
will prompt the user to select the file (currently rejects all but FITS types). 
Written specifically to support the Speckle Instrument to be used on the GEMINI North and South telescopes.
